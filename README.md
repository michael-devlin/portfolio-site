# Personal portfolio site built by React / hosted on Netflify

I built this portfolio to showcase some of the projects I worked on collaboratively during my time at Founders & Coders – a full stack, peer-led, bootcamp based in London – as well as some of the projcets I have built alone.

I decided to use React as a framework and Netlify as my deployment host. I made this choice so as to further solidify my knowledge in React and to gain more experience using Netlify (I had previously only used Vercel & Heroku)...

This Read Me is still a work in progress! :)
